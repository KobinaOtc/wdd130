                Ghana is a vibrant West African country known for its rich history, diverse culture, and warm hospitality. Bordered by CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Togo, it boasts 
                stunning landscapes, from lush rainforests to golden beaches along the Gulf of Guinea. As the first African nation to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957, 
                Ghana has a proud heritage, reflected in landmarks like Cape Coast Castle and the bustling capital, Accra. The country is famous for its lively music, dance, and 
                festivals, as well as its delicious cuisine, including jollof rice and fufu. With a thriving economy and strong traditions, Ghana is a symbol of unity and progress in 
                Africa.
